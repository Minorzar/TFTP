# TFTP

This is the repository of the TFTP client made in lab sessions of IT major.


## Question 1

	The first question needs us to get the parameters given by the user.
	Due to how we want to implement the client, we only focus on the server (called "hostname") in our code we use would had been the same if we also took care of the file with just some quick modifications (mostly the macros).

	The only errors currently handle are a wrong usage of the function or error writting in the different output (because there is nothing else that could go
	wrong yet).
